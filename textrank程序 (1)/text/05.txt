Rio said farewell to hosting the Olympics on Sunday as the closing ceremony experienced periods of rain that poured down on the thousands of athletes and spectators in attendance from around the world.The closing ceremony itself was a trimmed down version of what had been hoped for. There were speeches and fireworks and an uplifting video of the Rio 2016 highlights.Then the Japanese came in to accept the Olympic flag with promises that in four years, everybody would be invited to gather again and celebrate the best sports stars in the world.For Brazil it may have been a teary end. But it was also a relief that after Zika and all else, the finishing line had been reached.The closing ceremony included a celebration of Brazil's fauna and its diversity and beauty and some traditional music followed by the athletes from 207 competing nations.Ironically, officials also took advantage of the watching global TV audience to introduce its new 'Olympic channel', on the day that the sports action was over.Brazilian art was also highlighted with a tribute to Brazil's Serra da Capybara National park, a UNESCO World Heritage site.There was poetry, dancing and the audience were informed about Brazilian craft making including 'bringing clay to life.'While athletes from around the world packed the Rio Games closing ceremony, one of the biggest stars was absent - Brazil soccer great Pele.Instead, the three-time football World Cup champion went to Twitter to celebrate Brazil's first gold medal in his sport.During Sunday night's ceremony at Maracana Stadium, Pele tweeted: 'I waited for my whole life to see Brazil win gold at football and now my dream came true.'

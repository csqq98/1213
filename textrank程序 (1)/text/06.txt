RIO DE JANEIRO ¡ª Two U.S. Olympic swimmers were prevented from leaving Brazil on Wednesday night as differences emerged in their accounts of an armed robbery they said they endured last weekend.
The U.S. Olympic Committee said Wednesday evening that swimmers Jack Conger and Gunnar Bentz were removed from their return flight to the United States by Brazilian authorities.
Early Thursday morning, the USOC released a statement indicating Conger and Bentz were no longer being detained but were not yet free to leave the country.
According to the statement: "Jack Conger and Gunnar Bentz were detained Wednesday night shortly before their flight was scheduled to depart from Rio. They were released by local authorities with the understanding that they would continue their discussions about the incident on Thursday. James Feigen is also communicating with local authorities and intends to make further statements regarding the incident on Thursday as well.¡±
Bentz and Conger, a three-time All-Met swimmer of the year from Good Counsel High, were pictured by Brazil¡¯s TV Globo entering a police office at Rio de Janeiro¡¯s international airport with their carry-on luggage, but they did not comment to a reporter. The O Globo newspaper reported that the swimmers had boarded United Airlines Flight 128 to Houston and that two representatives from the U.S. Consulate and one from the USOC had arrived at the airport to accompany them.
